# Task 02 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset
This project was completed as part of my internship at SkillCraft Technologies.
The task involved performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python (in Google Colab) to understand passenger demographics, survival patterns, and key influencing features.

# 📌 Objective
Analyze the Titanic dataset to uncover insights into survival rates and influencing factors like gender, class, and age using EDA techniques.

# 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
Google Colab

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

# 📊 Analysis & Visualizations Performed
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and removed unnecessary columns.

Distribution Plots: Age and Fare distribution visualized using histograms and KDE plots.

Count Plots: Visualized passenger count by Gender and Pclass.

Box Plots: Analyzed Age distribution across passenger classes and survival status.

Heatmap: Showed correlation between features.

Bar & Pie Charts: Survival count by gender and class.

# 💡 Key Insights
Females had a higher survival rate compared to males.

First class passengers had better chances of survival.

Most passengers were between the ages of 20–40.

Children and women in higher classes had better survival outcomes.

The fare varied significantly with passenger class and survival.

# 🧠 What I Learned
Performing structured EDA using Python libraries.

Cleaning and transforming real-world datasets.

Visualizing relationships between categorical and numerical variables.

Drawing actionable insights from visual data exploration.
